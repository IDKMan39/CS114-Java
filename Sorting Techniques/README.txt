Title: Sorting algorithms for CS114. 
 
Description: This folder contains files demonstrating various sorting techniques implemented in java.
These algorithms are performed on both arrays and LinkedLists and are labeled as such. 

Code Author: Vincent Lombardo, Student, vjl@njit.edu
 
File Naming Convention: SortingAlgorithm_StudentName_Main_Datastructure.java
The base file name is composed of the sorting algorithm used, the first name of the student, the purpose of the file, and the data structure the sorting algorithm is implemented on. 
 
Optional Challenge - I coded all of the sorting algorithms for arrays, then went and completed them on linked lists. 
This was of similar difficulty for most of the algorithms, but got more difficult when implementing insertion sort and quicksort. 

File formats: .java
